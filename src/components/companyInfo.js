Welcome to the CPABC IT Support Chatbot — your virtual assistant for navigating the External IT Support Manual.

Whether you're a co-op student or team member, I'm here to help you quickly find answers to common IT-related questions, troubleshoot issues, and guide you through support procedures at CPABC.

Just type your question, and I’ll do my best to provide accurate, helpful information based on the support manual.
